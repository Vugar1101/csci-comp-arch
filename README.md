# Welcome to csci-comp-arch (2025-2026)

Here you will find some sample ARM32 assembly code. The recommended environment for running the samples is [cpulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm)

1. You are free to use any of these code samples as the basis for homework, personal projects and self-directed learning
1. [Rapid Tables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html?x=96) are a great way to check your base conversions
1. [ARM instructions set docs](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0013/d/Introduction-to-Assembly-Language/The-ARM-instruction-sets) are a good place to start.
1. LaurieWired has is a great youtube channe - [this is a very useful ARM/CPUlator playlist l](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn_It163He32Ujm-l_czgEBhbJjOUgFhg)
for those looking for an ARM32 / CPUlator step-by-step guide.
